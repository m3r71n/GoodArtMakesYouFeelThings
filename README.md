​

This project is an online art gallery to host and display the works of various artists including traditional media artists and new media artists and everything in between. Given the Coronavirus and the recent hit the art world took because of it, this project seeks to create a new forum for getting work out. It displays these featured works and it includes background about the organization and features profiles of people involved. Going forward, this project would be best to turn into a full fleged online gallery.
