​

This project is an online art gallery to host and display the works of various artists including traditional media artists and new media artists and everything in between. Given the Coronavirus and the recent hit the art world took because of it, this project seeks to create a new forum for getting work out. It displays these featured works and it includes background about the organization and features profiles of people involved. Going forward, this project would be best to turn into a full fleged online gallery.

# Features Used
​
1. Hamburger menu - used for the site menu on all pages.
2. Flexbox - For responsive boxes on the home page. Flexbox is also used to display the boxes for the artworks on the gallery page.
3. Use JS to hide parts of the page and make them appear on click - modals on gallery page to display full images.
4. Create a form (such as a ‘Contact Us’ form), validate at least 1 input (example, ensure email is in the proper format), and then use that information on your page somehow– on contact page, the confirmation alert message serves the first name back to the person filling out the form.
